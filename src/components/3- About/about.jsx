        <p>
          I'm Hamza, a passionate front-end developer with a strong focus on
          ReactJS. I love turning ideas into fully functional projects and
          continuously challenge myself to work on advanced and cutting-edge
          solutions. I've accumulated a wealth of experience and expertise
          through a diverse range of projects, I've had the privilege of working
          on projects ranging from css only projects to e-commerce dashboards.
          These experiences have provided me with a deep understanding of the
          technology landscape.
